I’ve been sick so lounged a lot over the course of a month and wasn’t up to doing much because I was being super careful and because I didn’t realise I had a bit of a foggy head until I started to feel better. Only then did I start to feel any boredom.,6,3,3,4,4,5,"I’m recently unemployed but was glad of it because I became unwell. I fear slightly what the future holds. I fear the possibility of a depression. I fear the lives of my children and a number of siblings. I am the youngest of ten with eight living siblings - at least five are in at risk categories and one who never smoked (but had a husband 40 years ago who did) has COPD. I am very very worried about how successful her self-isolation will go (I am glad she can work from home). I have a brother-in-law at extreme risk who is working on a wooden boat that is out of the water and has to be repaired before returning to the water in approximately two weeks - at a workplace with people smoking and smoking himself. I fear my sister (at less risk than him but still at risk) will be a widow before too long. I have fears for nieces, nephews and a great niece who is just one. My Aunty and Uncle are likely to die if they get it. Basically it sucks to be the youngest of ten right now with elderly relatives along with some unwell younger relatives. I’m even concerned for my ex-mother-in-law. And, selfish as this may sound (please note he was extremely nasty in our divorce and I lost all respect for him which has been compounded by his barely ever seeing his children) I am concerned my ex-husband (who is a doctor) might die because I don’t know how I will afford to live if he does. It will be hard on my children too and they don’t need that. I’m very familiar with everything going on and have watched it for some time. Although their actions have improved, I think the Australian government acted too late. I’m unhappy I was not tested while I was crook as I do not know with any certainty if I had Covid-19. If I did then my two children at home with me likely had it too (they have been sick too) and so three of us would be safe and maybe we could help in some way.  I think this is a time to use untrained people for basic nursing (but they could have been trained from January) while real nurses look after people who are extremely ill. Good nursing was apparently the greatest indicator during the 1918-19 Spanish Flu as to outcomes and it’s logical that one-on-one assistance is going to be good for patients. We should have been closed down earlier, we should have quarantined people coming in earlier - it’s not like there wasn’t information available- I’ve been able to find it with ease (including the non-peer-reviewed papers written by Chinese doctors. Non-peer-reviwed papers are pretty much all that is available right now. I’ve been unhappy at the suggestion that ships full of sick people would be turned away from our ports when we are so far from anywhere especially when we’ve spent millions in the past rescuing solo sailors! Finally, I think every child in the world ought to just get a re-set on school starting next year and we just look after their mental health this year. Their relatives are dying! They see what’s going on in the world! Their parents are in many cases unemployed and stressed and schooling is just an extra stress. They should have educational opportunities in any area of interest through education departments but only to keep them happy and occupied- they can pick what they like. The only exception should be (in Australia’s case) year 12 - unless on compassionate grounds they should choose not to continue. However, they need to have free internet if their parents cannot afford it and they need to have computers- even if it’s just a loan. There needs to be consideration for the difficult circumstances (individually in some cases - imagine if they’re surrounded by younger siblings with nowhere quiet to study). Thanks for the survey. Some questions were hard to answer due to me lying about crook for a month! I would have expressed a lot more unhappiness had I lost a job and been unable to pay bills because I had just bought some big ticket items and had used up all my money before all this. Fortunately my ex actually paid child support on time this month. Amazing!",2.7,"3,666,667","3,333,333",5,"4,333,333","3,666,667","4,666,667",3.6

No exemption from self isolating rules available so I can’t even attempt the move. No real commonsense. Ds (20 in first year at uni) now stuck in an impossible situation.

Apparently it’s acceptable that if I want to get our possessions and affect a move from one state to another to impose a rule on me that could result I’m my life being put in jeopardy because nobody else can safely shop for food for me. Supermarket delivery can substitute products with something similar. It’s not an acceptable situation and has resulted in extreme adverse affects for both myself and my special needs University student son.
